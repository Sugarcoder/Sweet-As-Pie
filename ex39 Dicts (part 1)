# Dictionary (aka "dicts", other languages call it "hashes")

# "Dict" lets you use anything, not just numbers. 

# "Dict" associates one thing to another.
# "Dict" is matching one item (keys) to another item (values). 




# Example: 

Candy_Kingdom = {'name': 'Bubblegum', 'age': 16, 'height': 8*20}

print Candy_Kingdom['name']  

print Candy_Kingdom['age']

print Candy_Kingdom['height']




# Another Example: 

Candy_Kingdom[1] = "Gummy Bears"

Candy_Kingdom[2] = "Sour Patch"

print Candy_Kingdom




# How to delete things from "Dicts":


del Candy_Kingdom['name']

del Candy_Kingdom[1]

del Candy_Kingdom[2]
