# append = calling a list and making it do things. 

# Example:

mycandy.append ('sweet')          # The ('  ') tells the computer that it is an argument


# Full Example: 


ten_colors = "Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Indigo Violet"

print "We need 10 colors, so let's add a few more." 


ten_colors.split(' ')

more colors = ["Pink", "White", "Black"]
