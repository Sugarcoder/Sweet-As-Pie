# GOOD RULES TO FOLLOW

# Rules for IF Statements:

# Every IF must have an ELSE.

# Never nest the IF more than two deep. 
# For example, if you put an IF inside another IF, you should move the second IF into another function. 

# Treat the IF like a paragraph. Each IF ELIF ELSE is like a set of sentences.
# Put blank lines before and after.

# Booleans should be simple. If they are complex, move their calculations earlier on and give it a good name.




# Rules for Loops:

 # WHILE loop is only to use forever (never use it, it'll drive you nuts.)
 # FOR loop is for all kinds of loops, like a fixed amount of things to loop over.
 # Ex: Eating 5 pieces of gummy bears until it's all gone.




 # Debugging Tips:

 # Try not to use a debugger because it may confuse you more.
 # The BEST way to debug a program is use "print".
 # Write parts of codes and then run it. 
 # Code a little, run a little, and fix a little.




# Starting New Project Tips:

# Make a list of things you should do, and then do them one at a time.
