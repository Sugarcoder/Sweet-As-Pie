# Modules are like dictionaries.

# Module =  A specialized dictionary that can store codes,
# so you could get it with the '-' operator.




mysweets = {'candy': "I like to eat candy."}
print mysweets['candy']


# If you create another module (ex. "sugar.py"), 
# and add "def sugar(): print "Sugar is sweet!", 
# you can call:

# import mysweets   
# mysweets.sugar() 
# in the script. 

# You can even add more variables (ex. cotton_candy)
# cotton_candy = "This is so soft."

# import mysweets
# mysweets.sugar()
# print mysweets.cotton_candy


# Example: 

mysweets['candy']   # Gets candy from the "dict"

mysweets.candy()    # Gets candy from the module  (This is assuming you created one already)

mysweets.cotton_candy  # Gets cotton_cotton from the module (except "cotton_candy" is a variable)
