# = Commenting only. Hashtags are avoided when runnint the script.

# print = prints a line.

# " " = quotations around a line.

# +, -, *, /,>=, >,< = Math. Need I say more? :)

# Variables = brownies, people, names, etc. 
# For example: my_name = Princess Bubblegum, my_job = princess

# Underscore line = This is used in order for the script to be read. 
# For example: "my_name", "my_job"

# % = The percent symbol is used to mean something and used after a line. 
# For example: print "My name is % and I am a %." % (my_name, my_job)


# x and y = Signifies what you define it.  
# For example: x = "If you're happy and you know it", y = "Clap your hands."
# print x, print y 


# end1, end 2 = Signifies what you define it. 
# For example: end1 = "H", end2 = "i"
# print end1 + end2


# Formatter = Transforms an abstract flow of formatting events into specific output events on written objects.
# Formatters allows various properties of a written object to be changed and restored. 
# For example: print formatter % ("Roses are red", "Violets are blue.")


# \n = This is like a break in a sentence. Kind of like when you hit RETURN and move below.
# For example: months: "\nJan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay"


# """ = This is when you write multiple lines at once.
# For example: print """ I wish I was a programmer. Don't you? You can create so many things with codes."""


# This is just for fun: 
# Grumpy_cat = "I am grumpy cat." 
# print grumpy_cat


# raw_input = This is where you can tell the user to input their own info
# For example: print "How old are you?"   age = raw_input()
# For example: age = raw_input ("How old are you? ")
# print "So you are %r old."
# %r = read


# from sys import argv = Extracting an argument from the computer 
# sys = system
# import = Grabs from
# argv = argument



# () = This is where you can input your own info. You could also leave it blank. 


# open = Opens a file


# Truncate = Destroys a file


# target.write = writes a line.
# For example: target.write(line1)
# line1 = raw_input("line 1: ")


# os.path = Operating system's path


# len(indata) = The length in the data

# in_file(read) = Read what is in the file.

# out_file.write(indata) = Writes the data out to the file


# def = Defines something
# For example: def print_one(arg1), def print_none()
# Another example: def cheese_and_crackers(cheese_count, boxes_of_crackers):
# print "You have %d cheese and %d boxes of crackers!" % (cheese_count, boxes_of_crackers)


# %d = D stands for digits. For example: print "%d candy canes." % candy_canes


# open(from_file) = Open from the file


# print f.read() = Reads the specified file

# def rewind(f): f.seek() = Seeks for the file and then reruns it


# current_file = The current file

# current_line = The current line


# def add (a, b): print "Adding %d + %d" % (a, b) = Adds two digits you want to add

# def subtract (a, b) = Subtracts digits

# def multiply (a, b) = Multiplies two digits

# def divide (a, b) = Divides two digits
