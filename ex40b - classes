# Classes are like modules. 

# Class = Takes a group of functions & data and places them inside a container,
# so you can access them with the '-' operator. 


# Example of a class: 

class myCandy(object):
	def _init_(self):        # _init_() is a function
		self.cotton_candy = "How much softer could I be?"

	def sugar(self):         # sugar() is a function. 
		print "I am the Sugar King!"


# Classes are good for creating millions of them at a time, and they won't interfere with one another.

# However, modules are only imported as one entire program.
